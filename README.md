Financial Risk Detection:
This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify individuals at high risk of default on financial obligations. The model is based on a comprehensive analysis of financial, demographic, and behavioral data.

Workflow:
  1.	Data Collection and Preprocessing:
    •	Acquire data from various sources, including application forms, previous loan history, and credit bureau inquiries.
    •	Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and data type inconsistencies.
  2.	Exploratory Data Analysis:
    •	Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns, relationships, and key risk factors associated with default.
    •	Use visualizations and statistical techniques to gain insights into the data.
  3.	Feature Engineering:
    •	Create new features and transform existing ones to enhance the model's predictive power.
    •	Apply feature scaling and one-hot encoding to prepare the data for modeling.
  4.	Model Training and Evaluation:
    •	Train a Random Forest classifier using the preprocessed data.
    •	Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    •	Conduct cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.

Execution:
  1.	To execute the project, follow these steps:
  2.	Install the required Python packages.
  3.	Clone the GitHub repository.
  4.	Load the data into your preferred data analysis environment.
  5.	Run the Python script to perform the analysis and train the model.
     
Evaluation:
  The model achieved an accuracy of 94%, a precision of 94%, a recall of 100%, and an F1-score of 97% on the test set. Cross- validation was used to ensure the model's robustness.
